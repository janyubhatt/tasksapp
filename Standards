Standards:

Naming Conventions:
When naming variables, functions and Handlers, use camelCase
When naming Handlers, use Capital first letters(always end in Handler)
when working with equals signs, use spaces
With CSS classes...Bootstrap uses dashes. 
With custom css, use camelCase
With mappings/dictionaries, use no spaces


HTML templating:
when working with errors/fields/ other mappings, do not use ['key':value] notation.
Instead, use '.' notation. Ex: fields.username when fields is a mapping.
